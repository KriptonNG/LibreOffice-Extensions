=============================
LibreOffice TinyCopy
=============================

This is a simple sample extension for LibreOffice written in Python.  It is
self contained in that it contains the full source to build itself. To do so,
unpack the oxt-extension with any program able to read the zip format.  Running
the script './build' in the unpacked source tree, will then recreate the
extension (and possible modifications).

Following below is a description of all the files in this extension and how
LibreOffice learns what to do with them.
